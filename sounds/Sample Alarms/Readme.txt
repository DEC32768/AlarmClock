If you prefer to wake up to standard alarm sounds (such as beeping and buzzing), or you might like to wake up to the sounds of nature (such as the ocean or the rain-forest), then you may use these sample alarms.

All you need to do is add the files to your iTunes library.
This is as easy as dragging the folders onto the iTunes icon in your dock.
The files will be automatically added to your iTunes library.

Note: if iTunes is NOT configured to copy the files to your iTunes Music Folder (iTunes Preferences -> Advanced -> General), then you need to first copy the folders onto your hard drive.

Also, you may want to uncheck the alarms in your iTunes library. Unchecking the alarms means they won't ever be played unless you specifically double-click on them. (Thus an annoying buzzing, or random nature sound, won't be played when you're in shuffle mode)  All alarm sounds have an artist name of "Sample Alarms" by default.  A quick way to uncheck all of them, after import, is to filter your library to only the sample alarms, and then command-click on the checkbox of one of the items.  Command-clicking on a checkbox either selects or un-selects all the items in the table view.

And of course, now that these sample alarms are in iTunes, you can use them whenever you want within the Alarm Clock application.

Enjoy!
